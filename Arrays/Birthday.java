/*
Suppose that people enter a room one at a time. How people must enter until
two share a birthday? Counterintuitively, after 23 people enter the room,
there is approximately a 50â€“50 chance that two share a birthday.
This phenomenon is known as the birthday problem or birthday paradox.

The birthday problem arises in many computer science applications, including
hashing, cryptographic attacks, and testing random number generators.
